Cryptography

Steganography
	• Hides the existence of data
	• Images, audio, or video can have hidden messages
	-Achieved by dividing the data and then hiding it in unused portions of the file
	• Hide data in file header that describes the file, between sections of the metadata
Cryptography
	• Practice of scrambling data so that information so that it can not be understood by unauthorized people
		○ Transposition, is when each letter if the message is rearranged
		○ Substitution, is when one letter is substituted for another letter
	· Plaintext (unencrypted data that is input for encryption or can be the output of decryption)
	· Ciphertext (scrambled and unreadable output of encryption)
	· Cleartext (Unencrypted data that isn't intended to be encrypted)

Cryptographic algorithms
	· Hash
	· Symmetric
	· Asymmetric
          - pad (long sequence of random letters)
	- Stream cipher (takes a character and replaces it with another)
	- Block cipher ( changes a entire block of plaintext at one time)
	- Sponge function ( takes as input a string of any length and returns a string of any requested variable length)
Symmetric 
	· Private key cryptography ( keeps the key private between the sender and recipient)
	· Strong encryption if key is kept secure
	· AES and blowfish and twofish
Asymmetric
	· Distributes and maintains key among multiple users
	· Uses two keys (private and public)
	- Public key is available to everyone and is freely distributed
	- Private key is know only to whom it belongs to
Important principles for asymmetric
	- Key pair
	- Public key
	- Private key
	- Both directions
Different asymmetric cryptographic algorithms
	
	· RSA (published in 1977)
	· ECC (users share one elliptic curve and one point on the curve)
	· DSA ( Creates a digital signature)
	· Key exchange (DH, DHE, ECDH, Perfect forward secrecy)
Encryption through Software
	· File and File System Cryptography
	· Disk Encryption
		○ Full disk encryption
		○ Volume level encryption
	· Database Encryption
		○ Database level encryption
Hardware Encryption
	· Can be embedded in hardware, and even in USB devices and standard hard drives
	· Built into USB which allows for all data written to be encrypted
	· Some USBs allow admins to remotely prohibit accessing the data, lock out a user, or even destroy all data
	· Self-encrypting drives
	· Hardware security model
	· Trusted Platform Module
Limits of Cryptography
	· Require both time and energy, which results in a resource versus security constraints
Attacks on Cryptography
	·  most common attacks are algorithm attacks and collision attacks
	· Collision attack (attempt to find two input strings of a hash function that produce the same hash results)
	· Birthday attack (based on birthday paradox which says for there to be a 50 percent chance of someone in a room sharing your birthday is that 253 people would need to be in the room)
