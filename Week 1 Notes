Notes For Week 1
Security is defined ad the “measures taken to ensure safety”
As the security in a Device increases convenience is often decreased.

Principles of Security (CIA)
Confidentiality makes sure that only authorized users may access information
Integrity makes sure that information hasn’t been tampered with and is correct
Availability makes sure that information is accessible to the correct users

Triple A 
Authentication act of ensuring that users have the correct credentials
Authorization allows or disallows users to take a particular action
Accounting makes a record that keeps track of who accessed the network, what the accessed, and when they left the network

Threat Actors
Is a individual that is responsible for attacks
Another word to call them is “attacker”
Unskilled attackers, shadow IT, ordanized crime, insiders, hacktivists, nation-state actors, and others

Shadow IT
Going pass corporate approval of technology purchases
Often ethical but weakens security
Oranized Crime
Close-knit group of highly- centralized enterprises set ip for engaging in illegal activities
Less risky and usally more rewarding than normal crime
Motive is financial gain

Insider Threats
Companys own employees, contractors and business partners
Motive could be revenge or blackmail
Hard to recognize when its happening

Hacktivists
A person or group that is highly motivated bu ideology
Often involves breaking into website and changing data
Motive is to cause disruption/chaos

Nation-State Actors
Government employing own state attackers for launching cyberattacks against other people.
Often involved in multiyear ubtrusion campaigns gathering highlysensitive economic, proprietary, or national security information
New class of attacks called advanced persistent threat use innbative attack tools that quitely extract data over and extended period of time

Competitors
Launch attacks agaisnt other systems to steal data
May steal data to gain competitive advantage

Brokers
Sells knowledge of a weakness to others for money
Uncover weaknesses and dont report them to software vendor but sell them to highest 
bidder

Cyberterrorists
Attacks a nations network and computer infrastructure to cause chaos
Targets can inclide a small group of computers or networks that can affect mass majority of people

Threat Vectors and Attack Surffaces
Digital platform that threat actors target for exploits
	Attack surfaces can be mainstream
 Primary targets of threat actors
Attack surfaces can be found in all technology settings
Continue to bear the brunt of attacks to this day

Supply chain
A network that moves a product from its creation to the end-user
Each link could be a potential threat vector
Malware could be injected into different products during its manufacturing, storage, and distribution ( supply chain infections)

Open source software
Software where the code is available for the public to use without any restrictions
Threat actor add malicious code to a open source project which infects unsuspecting victims

Categories of Vulnerabilities
Is the state of being exposed to the potential of being attacked or harmed
Cybersecurity vulnerabilities can be sorted into different  groups software, hardware, misconfigurations, and zero-day vulnerabilities

Software
Vulnerabilities can be found often, with OS software being the big one
Could include a malicious update

Hardware
These can lead to a successful attack Difficulty patching firmware, legacy platform, and end of life hardware

Misconfiguration
Often configuration setting not properly configured resulting in misconfigurations that lead to vulnerabilities
Zero-day vulnerabilities
 Can be exploited by attackers before anyone knows it exists
Its called zero-day because it give zero days heads
Extremely serious

Impacts of Attacks
Always results in several negative impacts
May make systems inaccessible, which results in lost productivity
May affect the public perception of the enterprise

Different data Impacts
Data loss: destruction of data so that it cannot be recovered
Data exfiltration: Stolen data distributed to other people
Data Breach: Stolen data to disclose in a unauthorized manor
Identity theft: Taking someones personally identifiable information to impersonate someone else
Information Security Resources

Defenders have multiple external resources like
Frameworks
Regulations
Legislation
Standards
Benchmarks/secure configuration guides
Information Sources

Framework
A series of documented processes used for defining policies and procedures for implementation and management 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology has three basic parts, Framework core, Implementation tiers, and Profiles
Regulations
Adhering to regulations is called regulatory compliance
Most organizations must follow a lot of regulations from different bodies
Information security
Broadly applicable regulations
Industry-specific regulations
U.S. state regulations
International regulations

Legislation
Laws can be enacted by governing bodies that can provide an information security resource which includes national, territorial, and state laws
A lot of entities are involved in passing multiple pieces of legislation which leads to a mess of legislation and is not always a good cybersecurity resource

Standards
Document approved through consensus by a recognized standardization body
Provides for frameworks, rules, guidelines, or characteristics for products or other related processes and production methods
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

Benchmarks/Secure Configuration Guides
Usually distributed by hardware manufacturers and software developers
Serves as a guideline for configuring a device or software so that it protects against attacks
Usually platform and vendor specific guides only applies to specific products
